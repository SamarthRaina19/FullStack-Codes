# Todo App — Explanation & Functionality

## Explanation 🧭
This is a simple Todo application that demonstrates core frontend concepts: creating, viewing, updating, and removing tasks. It uses standard web languages to provide an interactive UI where users can manage a list of todos. The app focuses on clarity and fundamentals (DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management) so it's ideal for learning or as a small exercise project.

Languages & visual cues:
- JavaScript — 🟨 (logic & interactivity)
- HTML — 🌐 (structure & markup)
- CSS — 🎨 (styling & layout)

## Functionality ✅
- Add a Todo ➕  
  - Type a task and submit to append it to the list.
- Mark Todo as Completed ✔️  
  - Toggle a todo's completed state (visual strike-through or style change).
- Edit a Todo ✏️  
  - Modify the text of an existing task inline or via an edit control.
- Delete a Todo 🗑️  
  - Remove tasks permanently from the list.
- Persist (optional) 💾  
  - Minimal implementations may persist to localStorage so tasks survive page reloads.
- Clear Completed ♻️  
  - Option to remove all completed tasks in one action.
- Count/Filter View 🔎  
  - Show counts or filter by All / Active / Completed to focus on specific tasks.

Each feature is implemented with straightforward, readable code to help learners trace how user actions map to DOM updates and state changes.
